Professionally, I focus on technical communication with an eye toward getting all involved parties speaking the same language.
- Project management, AI, Cloud, Scrum, Natural Language Processing and Python are a few words that express my main aims.

Personally, my focus includes the above passions and extends them with card playing, [writing books](/books) and [writing folk music](/music).

Fun fact: I'm also a trained house painter, or "Maler- und Lackierergeselle" (not accepting jobs :) ).
