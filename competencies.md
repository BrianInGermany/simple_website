Professionally, I focus on technical communication with an eye toward getting all involved parties speaking the same language.
- Project management, AI, cloud, Scrum, natural language processing and Python are a few words that express my main aims.
- My day-to-day takes place at [Adacor Hosting GmbH](https://adacor.com), where I work as a Technical Account Manager.

Personally, my focus includes the above passions and extends them with card playing, [writing books](/books) and [writing folk music](/music).

Fun fact: I'm also a journeyman house painter, or "Maler- und Lackierergeselle" (not accepting jobs).
