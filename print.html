<p>On a Friday afternoon<br>
Looking at rooftops<br>
Staring out the windows<br>
Till the sun drops</p>
<p>See the wind a-blowing<br>
Thinking unsubstantial thoughts<br>
As I grow old</p>
<p>Waiting on a change of pace to show up<br>
No one seems to bring the things we know up<br>
You can say hello<br>
Say goodbye before you go<br>
And it's all over<br>
All over</p>
<p>All over again<br>
Is it fare the well, my friend?<br>
First I saw you from a distance<br>
Then I moved on closer in<br>
Closer in<br>
Closer in</p>
<p>Something tells me everything is different<br>
Ever since the weather turned I feel it<br>
People looking round<br>
Never listening to the sounds<br>
Of their own stories</p>
<p>On an early Monday morning I'm back at it<br>
Taking care of business that I hadn't<br>
You can give a call<br>
Take a break till eveing falls<br>
And its all over<br>
All over</p>
<p>All over again<br>
Is it fare the well, my friend?<br>
First I saw you from a distance<br>
Then I moved on closer in<br>
Closer in<br>
Closer in</p>
<p>All over again<br>
Is it fare the well, my friend?<br>
First I saw you from a distance<br>
Then I moved on closer in<br>
Closer in<br>
Closer in</p>

<p>At the end of the day<br>
As the sun declines<br>
There's a young man<br>
Walking down the riverside<br>
To reach you<br>
To reach you</p>
<p>With his bags packed heavy<br>
And his heart packed light<br>
With his step so steady<br>
And his smiling eyes<br>
He'll meet you<br>
He'll meet you</p>
<p>And she's waiting at the door<br>
But the one she's waiting for's<br>
Not coming home for dinner after five<br>
Every minute is so cruel<br>
When you haven't heard the news<br>
That Dad withheld<br>
For after dinner time</p>
<p>Keep your head in the game<br>
Through the ache and the pain<br>
And you'll come out alright</p>
<p>So many feeling the same<br>
We'll rebuild and regain<br>
And we'll weather the night</p>
<p>There's chances to score<br>
Turn less into more<br>
Waiting for you to find<br>
Keep your head in the game<br>
Through the ache and the pain<br>
And you'll come out just fine</p>

<h1 id="i-know">I Know</h1>
<p>On an icy February day<br>
In my home town<br>
Streets are full as people pack inside<br>
And pack back out<br>
Every man and every woman<br>
Got their cares to tend<br>
They'll keep hustlin' and bustlin'<br>
TIll the long day's end</p>
<p>And I know<br>
I know, you know, we know, they know<br>
And I know<br>
I know, I go, you go, we go</p>
<p>GIve me love and give me sugar<br>
When I come back home<br>
When we kick the winter weather<br>
And we're on our own<br>
In the evenin' after dinner girl<br>
The stage is ours<br>
We'll keep livin' life worth livin'<br>
From the very start</p>
<p>And I know<br>
I know, you know, we know, they know<br>
And I know<br>
I know, I go, you go, we go</p>

<p>Just a stone's throw<br>
From your front door<br>
Just a step around the corner<br>
From your local corner store<br>
There's an old bar<br>
With a faded sign<br>
Sayin' happy hour's six to eight<br>
And Thursday's open mic</p>
<p>Come, sing a song or two<br>
Rock and roll or Delta blues<br>
Take us on a journey far away<br>
Somber words and happy tunes<br>
Steady beats we're tappin' to<br>
Take us to a calmer, kinder place</p>
<p>So now strum one more love song<br>
Set all our troubled minds at ease<br>
Sing loud and sing on<br>
Let all your hopes and stories ring</p>

<h1 id="love-me-for-a-minute">Love Me for a Minute</h1>
<p>On a dark winter's day<br>
I know where we're going<br>
I know where the words are flowing<br>
That you say</p>
<p>Under streetlamps bright and shrill<br>
I can see the light diminish<br>
In your eyes now as you finish<br>
What's to tell</p>
<p>Love me for a minute<br>
Love me for a day<br>
Even for a moment<br>
Beggin' you to stay</p>
<p>Every single ounce of you I'm missing<br>
Every morning</p>
<p>Every word you tell me<br>
Every word you say<br>
Takes me to the limit<br>
And baby, by the way</p>
<p>Every single ounce of you I'm missing<br>
Every morning</p>
<p>On a warm summer's eve<br>
I remember times before us<br>
When our verses matched the choruses<br>
We'd sing</p>
<p>Autumn fell like a stone<br>
On a city so familiar<br>
On the very walls and pillars<br>
We called home</p>
<p>Love me for a minute<br>
Love me for a day<br>
Even for a moment<br>
Beggin' you to stay</p>
<p>Every single ounce of you I'm missing<br>
Every morning</p>
<p>Every word you tell me<br>
Every word you say<br>
Takes me to the limit<br>
And baby, by the way</p>

<p>Love me for a minute<br>
Love me for a day<br>

And baby, by the way</p>
<p>Every single ounce of you I'm missing<br>
Every morning</p>

Every Monday, they're feelin' blue<br>
In the early morning with the cat still snoring<br>
I'm just lyin' there dreamin' of you</p>
<p>There comes a time<br>
Repeat and rewind<br>

Come home and push play<br>
We'll make a Monday our new Sunday night!<br>

<p>Good day, good night<br>
From the sunshine strong<br>
To the pale moonlight<br>
We've been walkin' through<br>
This part of town<br>
Since the sky went bright<br>
And till the sun went down</p>
<p>Though the rain may fall<br>
On us now<br>
We'll keep moving on<br>
To the sound</p>
<p>That we know<br>
That we love<br>
That we are<br>
Though we stumble<br>
There is no road ahead<br>
We won't go</p>
<p>Be it morn<br>
Be it eve<br>
Every road<br>
We will follow<br>
Every step<br>
One step closer to home</p>

<p>After years of drought<br>
Came months of ragin' rain<br>
Pourin' down across<br>
The mid-Virginia plain</p>
<p>Annie-Jo was bound for Blacksburg<br>
Ten past eight<br>
But the flooding on the James<br>
Won't be delayed</p>
<p>Hallelujah!<br>
My, oh my<br>
Isn't love enough<br>
To bring us through the night</p>
<p>Hallelujah!<br>
By your side<br>
I can brave the roughest waters<br>
Of our lives</p>
<p>Sittin' by the bar<br>
At Jackie Smith's saloon<br>
Pray to God and hope<br>
My baby's coming soon</p>
<p>On the wall the clock is tickin'<br>
Loud and strong<br>
In the window rain is pourin'<br>
Ever on</p>
<p>Hallelujah!<br>
My, oh my<br>
Isn't love enough<br>
