# Closer In    
    
On a Friday afternoon    
Looking at rooftops    
Staring out the windows    
Till the sun drops    
    
See the wind a-blowing    
Thinking unsubstantial thoughts    
As I grow old    
    
Waiting on a change of pace to show up    
No one seems to bring the things we know up    
You can say hello    
Say goodbye before you go    
And it's all over    
All over    
    
All over again    
Is it fare the well, my friend?    
First I saw you from a distance    
Then I moved on closer in    
Closer in    
Closer in    
    
Something tells me everything is different    
Ever since the weather turned I feel it    
People looking round    
Never listening to the sounds    
Of their own stories    
    
On an early Monday morning I'm back at it    
Taking care of business that I hadn't    
You can give a call    
Take a break till eveing falls    
And its all over    
All over    
    
All over again    
Is it fare the well, my friend?    
First I saw you from a distance    
Then I moved on closer in    
Closer in    
Closer in    
    
All over again    
Is it fare the well, my friend?    
First I saw you from a distance    
Then I moved on closer in    
Closer in    
Closer in    
    
# Keep Your Head in the Game    
    
At the end of the day    
As the sun declines    
There's a young man    
Walking down the riverside    
To reach you    
To reach you    
    
With his bags packed heavy    
And his heart packed light    
With his step so steady    
And his smiling eyes    
He'll meet you    
He'll meet you    
    
And she's waiting at the door    
But the one she's waiting for's    
Not coming home for dinner after five    
Every minute is so cruel    
When you haven't heard the news    
That Dad withheld    
For after dinner time    
    
Keep your head in the game    
Through the ache and the pain    
And you'll come out alright    
    
So many feeling the same    
We'll rebuild and regain    
And we'll weather the night    
    
There's chances to score    
Turn less into more    
Waiting for you to find    
Keep your head in the game    
Through the ache and the pain    
And you'll come out just fine    
    
At the end of the day

# I Know     
On an icy February day    
In my home town    
Streets are full as people pack inside    
And pack back out    
Every man and every woman    
Got their cares to tend    
They'll keep hustlin' and bustlin'    
TIll the long day's end    
    
And I know    
I know, you know, we know, they know    
And I know    
I know, I go, you go, we go    
    
GIve me love and give me sugar    
When I come back home    
When we kick the winter weather    
And we're on our own    
In the evenin' after dinner girl    
The stage is ours    
We'll keep livin' life worth livin'    
From the very start    
    
And I know    
I know, you know, we know, they know    
And I know    
I know, I go, you go, we go    
    
And I know    
I know, you know, we know, they know    
    
And I know    
I know, you know, we know, they know    
And I know    
I know, I go, you go, we go    
    
# Strum One More Love Song    
    
Just a stone's throw    
From your front door    
Just a step around the corner    
From your local corner store    
There's an old bar    
With a faded sign    
Sayin' happy hour's six to eight    
And Thursday's open mic    
    
Come, sing a song or two    
Rock and roll or Delta blues    
Take us on a journey far away    
Somber words and happy tunes    
Steady beats we're tappin' to    
Take us to a calmer, kinder place    
    
So now strum one more love song    
Set all our troubled minds at ease    
Sing loud and sing on    
Let all your hopes and stories ring    
    
Come sing a song or two    
Rock and roll or Delta blues    
Take us on a journey far away    
Somber words and happy tunes    
Steady beats we're tappin' to    
Take us to a calmer, kinder place    
    
So now strum one more love song    
Set all our troubled minds at ease    
Sing loud and sing on    
Let all your hopes and stories ring    
    
Just a stone's throw    
From your front door    
Just a step around the corner    
From your local corner store

# Love Me for a Minute    
    
On a dark winter's day    
I know where we're going    
I know where the words are flowing    
That you say    
    
Under streetlamps bright and shrill    
I can see the light diminish    
In your eyes now as you finish    
What's to tell    
    
Love me for a minute    
Love me for a day    
Even for a moment    
Beggin' you to stay    
    
Every single ounce of you I'm missing    
Every morning    
    
Every word you tell me    
Every word you say    
Takes me to the limit    
And baby, by the way    
    
Every single ounce of you I'm missing    
Every morning    
    
On a warm summer's eve    
I remember times before us    
When our verses matched the choruses    
We'd sing    
    
Autumn fell like a stone    
On a city so familiar    
On the very walls and pillars    
We called home    
    
Love me for a minute    
Love me for a day    
Even for a moment    
Beggin' you to stay    
    
Every single ounce of you I'm missing    
Every morning    
    
Every word you tell me    
Every word you say    
Takes me to the limit    
And baby, by the way    
    
Every single ounce of you I'm missing    
Every morning    
    
Love me for a minute    
Love me for a day    
Even for a moment    
Beggin' you to stay    
    
Every single ounce of you I'm missing    
Every morning    
    
Every word you tell me    
Every word you say    
Takes me to the limit    
And baby, by the way    
    
Every single ounce of you I'm missing    
Every morning    
    
# Sunday Lovers    
Every Sunday lover's got a favorite color    
Every Monday, they're feelin' blue    
In the early morning with the cat still snoring    
I'm just lyin' there dreamin' of you    
    
There comes a time    
Repeat and rewind    
Watching the same old show    
By your side    
After the day    
Come home and push play    
We'll make a Monday our new Sunday night!

Couchin' in the day    
Couchin' our live-long worries away    
With you in the morning    
And when it's time to play    
With you there's one sweet spot I will stay    
I will stay    
I will stay

# Good Day Good Night    
Good day, good night    
From the sunshine strong    
To the pale moonlight    
We've been walkin' through    
This part of town    
Since the sky went bright    
And till the sun went down    
    
Though the rain may fall    
On us now    
We'll keep moving on    
To the sound    
    
That we know    
That we love    
That we are    
Though we stumble    
There is no road ahead    
We won't go    
    
Be it morn    
Be it eve    
Every road    
We will follow    
Every step    
One step closer to home    
    
Good day, good night

# Flooding on the James  
  
After years of drought  
Came months of ragin' rain  
Pourin' down across  
The mid-Virginia plain  
  
Annie-Jo was bound for Blacksburg  
Ten past eight  
But the flooding on the James  
Won't be delayed  
  
Hallelujah!  
My, oh my  
Isn't love enough  
To bring us through the night  
  
Hallelujah!  
By your side  
I can brave the roughest waters  
Of our lives  
  
Sittin' by the bar  
At Jackie Smith's saloon  
Pray to God and hope  
My baby's coming soon  
  
On the wall the clock is tickin'  
Loud and strong  
In the window rain is pourin'  
Ever on  
  
Hallelujah!  
My, oh my  
Isn't love enough  
To bring us through the night  
  
Hallelujah!  
By your side  
I can brave the roughest waters  
Of our lives  
  
Hallelujah!  
My, oh my  
Isn't love enough  
To bring us through the night  
  
Hallelujah!  
By your side  
I can brave the roughest waters  
Of our lives
