  <h1>Clustering Ideas with IdeaStackr</h1>

  <h1 id="an-anecdote">An Anecdote</h1>
<p>When writing one of my first research papers in university, I was plagued by a writers’ block. Though no newbie to writing, I found the topic for this particular paper difficult to break down into a logical sequence, and had no idea where to start.</p>

<p>Finally, I decided to forget about the sequence and the logical structure, and focus on the atomic building blocks of my essay: the ideas extracted from my sources and the new thoughts that came to me while reading them.</p>

<p>And I wrote them down on notecards with the source name, page number, and type of information, in a format that looked a little like this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/cardExample.png" alt="notecard" /></p>

<h1 id="stacking-ideas">Stacking Ideas?</h1>

<p>Ideas on notecards are all good and well. But how, you ask, did I ever bring structure into my dud of a research topic?</p>

<p>I stacked my ideas. Like this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/clusterCards.jpg" alt="stackedIdeas" /></p>

<p>By turning the desk into a coordinate system, I can deal out the notecards I’ve written into stacks on an alphanumeric grid, and group similar cards to similar cards.</p>

<p>You need a grid chart like in the picture to keep track of what cluster represents what. And it involves a lot of renaming stacks as you shuffle around cards to ensure each stack has an appropriate name.</p>

<h1 id="clustering-clusters">Clustering Clusters</h1>
<p>And when you’re done, it all begins again; you can cluster your clusters and name those on a new grid chart to achieve the next-higher level of order. Voilá Table of Contents.</p>

<h1 id="analog-and-digital">Analog and Digital</h1>
<p>IdeaStacking works great with pen and paper, just print out blank cards like the one above and get writing!</p>

<p>But if you have some basic Python knowledge, you can also use my <a href="https://github.com/BrianInGermany/IdeaStackr">IdeaStackr Repository</a> for a step-by-step description of how to record your ideas in CSV and then automatically output cards in JPG format for printing four-to-a-page.</p>
