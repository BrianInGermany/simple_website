Making the perfect pancake is no small feat. Sure, with just four ingredients, one might say, "Whatever could go wrong?".

> FLOUR, BUTTERMILK, EGGS, BAKING SODA

And I guarantee you, whatever you do with those ingredients (within the limits of reason) you'll get a batter that, without doubt, can be turned into discs of dough widely recognizable as pancakes.

But if you want them perfect-- and you want to do it reproducibly-- it takes way more than those four bullet points.

It takes practice. Maybe you need a recipe to remind you of the ratios-- maybe a mnemonic to tell you if the batter should be like pudding or like melted ice cream.

Whatever aids you avail, the first few batches will be hit-or-miss. Oh, you'll have some great ones you can post on Instagram-- and you'll have some flat ones more akin to a tortilla than a fluffy buttermilk flapjack.

The fact remains, the learned instinct necessary for perfect pancakes, Sunday after Sunday, comes from getting your hands dirty-- again and again.

In the IT business, we have solutions hitting the pan day in, day out. And what separates the seasoned IT flapjack flippers from the weekend wannabes is their ability to produce those fluffy, maple-syrup spongecakes time and time again.

Sure, everyone has an off-day. But reliable professionals know their way around a griddle.

Do you have any solution providers that make great pancakes? 

I'd love to hear about it!
