Problems can be complicated, and each vintage is its own witches' brew of causes and considerations.

But by and large, problems are cocktails of just a few basic ingredients:


**Strategic causes**  
The symptom at hand is a necessary effect of an overarching strategy that benefitted other things elsewhere.

**Communicational causes**  
Somewhere in the pipeline, requirements got lost in translation. Or it's a case of the _do what I mean, not what I say_ effect.

**Organizational causes**  
The structure of the team and its leadership form is running contrary to the nature of the task.

**Technical causes**   
The tools aren't working the way we expected. Are we using the right end?

**Criterial causes**  
Who says it's a problem and why? Is our measuring stick potentially the real problem? 

**Human causes**  
Do the people involved bring the right skill sets to the table? Is the team chemistry more like a chain reaction?

_Does_ the business world need another acronym? 

No. 

But is it fun to create them and useful for disentangling chaotic situations?

It certainly is for me.
