## SINNBILDER 
A picture tells a thousand words... SINNBILDER even more!

> _Sinnbilder:_ German, from the components _Sinn_ (meaning) + _Bilder_ (pictures). Definition: any object or situation that stands abstractly for another.

SINNBILDER were crafted for reflection. Whether at work or play, they get people talking about what's important to them, and bring new perspectives to the fore.

SINNBILDER throw oil on the communicative fire via pictorial metaphors that evoke emotions and associations in the interviewee. Each card displays two opposite metaphors to get people thinking.

They're a listening tool!
